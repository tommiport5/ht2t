.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ht2t
Hypertext to text converter. The command parses an html file and outputs the textual content only in plain text format. 
The output can be used for reading it with text-to-speech to visually impaired users or to postprocess it with text analysis software.
.TP
ht2t is designed to accept input from wget (either in a pipe, or, in case of wget -r, from a directory tree) and give output to espeak (see examples).
.TP
The input in case of \fB\-f\fR (or when using the standard input) may contain a sequence of web pages, which are processed separately and concatenated to the output.
.TP
The input is converted to UTF-8 before processing, if a meta-tag designating the charset ist present. Some character entities (&....;) are converted to UTF-8 too.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \fB\-f\fR " " \fI<input_file>\fR

.TP
.BR \fB\-d\fR " " \fI<input_directory>\fR
Process \fI<input_directory>\fR recursively. All files with the extensions .html and .htm are processed and concatenated to the output.
.TP
.BR \fB\-o\fR " " \fI<output_file>\fR
